# Azure DevOps Secure Files

Secure files allow you to store files you can share across pipelines. Use the Secure Files library to store files like:

- signing certificates
- Apple Provisioning Profiles
- Android Keystore files
- SSH keys

These files can be stored on the server without committing them to your repository.
